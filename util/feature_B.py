        The function computes the mean combined index M = I * (1 - C) over the top-k blobs using the following steps:
            1) I = perimeter^2 / (4 * pi * area) -> spikiness measure
                A perfect circle has I = 1, while a more irregular shape has I > 1
            2) C = area / area_hull -> convexity measure
                A perfect convex shape has C = 1, while a more irregular shape has C < 1
            3) M = I * (1 - C) -> combined index
                So when a blob is both spiky (I > 1) and highly concave (1 - C appr = 1) M becomes large
                If it is either smooth (I = 1) or convex (C appr = 1) M becomes small
